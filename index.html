            <h2>The Ninja 300 Has Got The Looks!</h2>
            <p>
                The most obvious fact that stands out about the Ninja 300 is that it does not look like a beginner bike whatsoever.
                All of the styling and design is taken directly from it's older sibling, the Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R.
                If you are concerned that people will think you only have a 'starter bike', the you won't have to worry with this one!
                Only real experts would be able to tell that it is.
            </p>

            <h2>Save Money When Buying The Kawasaki Ninja 300</h2>
            <p>
                For a beginner bike, this can really save you a lot of cash. The MSRP for a brand new 2015 model Ninja 300 is $5,299 with ABS and $4,999 without ABS (though it's best if you go for the ABS version)
                If you're really tight on cash, you can get a used Ninja 300 for even cheaper. This is a motorcycle you can ride in the streets, up in the hills, on the freeway, and even long trips, only for five thousand.
                For the ZX-6R, you'd be paying over double the price of the Ninja 300 which is around $12,699.
            </p>
            <p>
                This bike also has amazing gas mileage. The original Ninja 250 was already very efficient with fuel and so they carried that over for the Ninja 300.
                It's common to see real world gas mileage of between 50-60mpg with spirited riding on the Ninja 300. If you were conscious of your fuel and often avoided getting low fuel.
                You could easily stretch that out to 70mpg or higher.
            </p>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Should you get the Ninja 300 as a beginner? YES.</b> The bike is easy to ride, fun on the road, and has more than a few features to make things easier
                (and keep you safe!). The only thing that makes it less ideal is the fact that it comes fully faired, meaning there are lots of plastic bits that can get cracked or crushed if you drop the bike.
                This matters because most beginner riders drop their first bike at some point. Even experienced riders can have this happen to them.
